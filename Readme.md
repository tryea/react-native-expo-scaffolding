# React Native + Expo Scaffolding

## Why we need scaffolding
Setting up expo from beginning in tired thing, and it is always the same thing.
this scaffolding to reduce setup time from beginning, so it would be easy for next project to develop


## Package installed
- expo
- react-native
- react
- expo-status-bar
- react-native-svg
- react-native-svg-transformer

## Note
### metro.config.js
metro config added based on [https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer] to enable exporting svg file directly from assets folder. by that at later time, all icon will used SVG to make it constant for every project, rather than installed specific package
